# Supabase & React: A Developer's Logbook

This repository documents my journey building a TimeTracker application with React, TypeScript, and Supabase. It serves as a collection of detailed debugging reports and architectural decisions. As a starting developer, I'm using this space to solidify my learnings and help others who might encounter similar issues.
